=== Per step information ===

v <var> <const_value>
uc <clause> <lit_or_zero>
u+ <var>
u- <var>
s <nonnegative_value>,...,<nonnegative_value>
d <var>,<decision_value>
a <var>,<nonnegative_value>
clause <clause> <learned> lits <lit> ... <lit>
delete_clause <clause>
conflict <var>

Where:
 - <var> is a variable ID
 - <clause> is a clause ID
 - <lit> is a either <var> or -<var>
 - <lit_or_zero> is either <lit> or 0
 - <const_value> is in {-1, 0, 1}
 - <decision_value> is in {-1, 1}
 - <nonnegative_value> is in [0, infty]
 - <learned> indicates if the clause is learned or original
