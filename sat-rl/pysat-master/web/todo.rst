PySAT toolkit is a work in progress. Although it can already be helpful in many
practical settings (and it **was** successfully applied by its authors for a
number of times), it would be great if some of the following additional
features were implemented:

-  more SAT solvers to support (e.g. `CryptoMiniSat
   <https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/>`__, `RISS
   <http://tools.computational-logic.org/content/riss.php>`__ among many
   others)

-  pseudo-Boolean constraint encodings

-  formula *(pre-)processing*

-  lower level access to some of the solvers' internal parameters
   (e.g. *variable activities*, etc.)

-  high-level support for arbitrary Boolean formulas (e.g. by Tseitin-encoding
   [16]_ them internally)

All of these will require a significant effort to be made. Therefore, we would
like to encourage the SAT community to contribute and make PySAT a tool for an
easy and comfortable day-to-day use. :)
