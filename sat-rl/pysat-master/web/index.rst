PySAT: SAT technology in Python
===============================

PySAT is a Python (2.7, 3.4+) toolkit, which aims at providing a simple and
unified interface to a number of state-of-art `Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem>`__ solvers as
well as to a variety of cardinality encodings. The purpose of PySAT is to
enable researchers working on SAT and its applications and generalizations to
easily prototype with SAT oracles in Python while exploiting incrementally the
power of the original low-level implementations of modern SAT solvers.

PySAT can be helpful when solving problems in `NP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)>`__ but also `beyond NP
<http://beyondnp.org/>`__. For instance, PySAT is handy when one needs to
quickly implement a MaxSAT solver, an MUS/MCS extractor or enumerator, an
abstraction-based QBF solver, or any other kind of tool solving an application
problem with the (potentially *multiple* and/or *incremental*) use of a SAT
oracle.
